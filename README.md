**User Modeling in Social Media: Gender and Age Detection**

Identified characteristics of social media users, namely gender and age, by training deep learning (including vanilla RNN and LSTM) and classical machine learning models (including SVM and logistic regression) on the textual posts they have shared on Twitter.

* Achieved 79.6% validation accuracy with a feedforward neural network consisting of word embedding, flattening, and two densely-connected layers.
* Achieved 76.9% accuracy with a bidirectional LSTM architecture.
